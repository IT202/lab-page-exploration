# Lab - Page Exploration

Modern web browsers include a variety of developer tools to allow us to examine the transmission, structure and functioning of files.   In class, we'll use using the Chrome browser and the [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools).

We'll use a couple of those tools in this lab to examine a few pages;  our goal is to **start** understanding the Document Object Model and the transmission of files.
